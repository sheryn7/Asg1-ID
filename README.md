# Nasty Cookie Revamp

**Project Overview**
This website aims to redesign and modernise the Nasty Cookie brand to make it the next new hangout spot for the youths. My approach begins with a full website revamp to create a smoother, more visually engaging interface as it lacks strong product visibility and a structured layout. 
I also believe the current signature blue branding feels dated so I explored a refreshed, modern colour theme to better match today’s aesthetic expectations. Overall, the revamped design focuses on improving product discovery, simplifying the ordering process and showcasing the brand’s bold personality in a way that feels contemporary and appealing to the younger customers.

**Design Process**
This website is designed primarily for:
•	Busy shoppers who want a fast and easy online ordering experience
•	Young adults and teens who enjoy trendy desserts
•	Customers who value halal-certified and freshly baked products
•	People looking for customisable or giftable desserts

Users of this website typically want to:
•	Quickly browse or search for products
•	Check product details, allergens and pricing
•	Customise their cookies or gift boxes in bulk
•	Order for delivery or pickup easily with no additional platform fee
•	Order event and corporate services

How my redesign helps them achieve it:
The redesigned layout improves clarity and brings key product categories forward right from the start. With a simpler navigation system, consistent page structure and clear visual hierarchy, users can locate what they need much more quickly. 

User Stories
•	As a first-time visitor, I want to quickly understand the brand’s offerings so that I know what products I can buy
•	As a mobile user, I want a layout that is easy to navigate on my phone so that I can shop even when I’m on the go
•	As a customer with dietary needs, I want to see labels like halal-certified or allergen information so that I can make safe choices
•	As an event organiser, I want to select multiple flavours and quantities at once so that I can easily prepare a large order for a corporate meeting or party
